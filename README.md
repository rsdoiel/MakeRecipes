MakeRecipes
===========

A collection of Makefile examples for various languages
and compiler. Compiler or language is expressed as an
extension to the name "Makefile". E.g. Makefile.Golang is a
general purpose makefile for a Go project, Makefile.obnc is a
general purpose makefile for a Oberon-07 project compiled with
the OBNC compiler.

The goal of the Makefile recipes is to provide a single makefile
that can function as a template for most of the projects I work
with with minimal changes (e.g. changing the project name at the
file of the Makefile).

I've made the assumption that GNU Make is being used and that a
POSIX shell is available to Make.
